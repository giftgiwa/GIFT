                        <p className="body technologies">I started programming in my senior year of high school with Java in AP Computer Science A. After practicing a bit, I've expanded into other programming languages through my college coursework and self-studying. At the moment, I’ve worked with <span id="html5">HTML</span>, <span id="css">CSS</span>, <span id="js">JavaScript</span>, <span id="java">Java</span>, <span id="c-sharp">C#</span>, <span id="python">Python</span>, and <span id="three-js">THREE.js</span> so far.</p>

                        <p className="body">I’m interested in app development (mainly front-end), and computer graphics. I also like playing video games (especially Mario Kart) and – though I’m new to them – music production and creating 3D designs.</p>
